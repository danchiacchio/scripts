# ðŸ”§ VMware Tools ESXi Upgrader

A Python script that automates the process of **checking** and **upgrading VMware Tools** on multiple ESXi hosts via SSH.

## âœ¨ Features

- âœ… Secure password prompt for root credentials
- âœ… Connects to multiple ESXi hosts
- âœ… Retrieves currently installed VMware Tools version
- âœ… Copies offline bundle to `OSDATA` partition on each host
- âœ… Installs new VMware Tools without requiring a reboot
- âœ… Displays results in a clear, formatted table

## Script versions:

py_vESXiTools.py
- This is the first version;
- It is necessary to manually create the esxi_hosts.txt file and add all ESXi hosts into this file.

py_vESXiTools-v2.py
- It can grab all ESXi hosts under the vCenter Server and create the file esxi_hosts.txt with all ESXi hosts.

py_vESXiTools-v3.py
- This is the latest version;
- It can connect to the specified vCenter and grab all connected ESXi hosts under the vCenter;
- In this version, the .txt file to store the hosts will not be created (it stores it in the script logic/memory);
- If the SSH service is not running on the connected ESXi hosts, SSH will be started before executing the host's commands;
- If you need to disable SSH service on all ESXi hosts after all, you can do that (there is an option for it).

## ðŸ“‹ Requirements

- Python 3.x (I just tested with Python 3.12.3 - I did not test with earlier Python versions)
- `paramiko` library (SSH connections)
- SSH must be enabled on all ESXi hosts
- All ESXi hosts must use the **same root password**
- Download the VMware Tools Package (VMware Tools Offline VIB Bundle .zip) and place it on the same script directory
- Edit the script to type the correct VMware Tools Offline VIB Bundle name

Install `paramiko` if needed:

```bash
pip install paramiko
