## ðŸ“‹ Requirements

- Python 3.x (I just tested with Python 3.12.3 - I did not test with earlier Python versions)
- `paramiko` library (SSH connections)
- SSH must be enabled on all ESXi hosts
- All ESXi hosts must use the **same root password**
- Download the VMware Tools Package (VMware Tools Offline VIB Bundle .zip) and place it on the same script directory
- Edit the script to type the correct VMware Tools Offline VIB Bundle name

Install `paramiko` if needed:

```bash
pip install paramiko
