py_vESXiTools-auto.py
- It's not necessary create a source file with all ESXi hosts.
- With this version, we can select in what vSphere Cluster we must to work on.
- There is a possibility to work on a specific host inside a cluster.

- Python 3.x (I just tested with Python 3.12.3 - I did not test with earlier Python versions)
- `paramiko` library (SSH connections)
- All ESXi hosts must use the **same root password**
- Download the VMware Tools Package (VMware Tools Offline VIB Bundle .zip) and place it on the same script directory

## Script Usage

To use the "manual" version of the script, you should update the following variables with your values:

 27 hosts_file = "esxi_hosts.txt"
 29 username = "root"
 30 local_file_path = "VMware-Tools-12.5.2-core-offline-depot-ESXi-all-24697584.zip"
 31 temp_dir_name = "vmware-tools-temp"

```bash
python3 py_vESXiTools.py
```

To use the "auto" version of the script, you just run the script:

```bash
python3 py_vESXiTools-auto.py
```
